# The problem

General-purpose models are **too expensive** and **not good enough** for specific use cases in Latin America. There's a need for an API that excels at these tasks at a reasonable cost. 



a secondary yet related problem is the lack of infrastructure for hosting a private company's models (either private or open source models). 

Say a company finetunes a model to improve the performance on their business relevant tasks. The next question/problem he will have is how do I serve this model at scale? 
This opens up a secondary business opportunity for surus, where we do the autoscaling infra to serve the models we choose, but we can also offer to do the infra for private models for companies. Most companies working on products that are not AI themselves (but enhanced by AI), will prefer to outsource the infra to serve their proprietary model




## Customer discovery insights
Interviews with 10+ AI company founders and chief officers revealed key pain points and needs.

Specialized Models
Generalist AI fails in niche domains (e.g., Legal, Agro, Accented STT)

Cost & Predictability
High costs for embeddings, STT, and overall cost management are major concerns.

Reliability & Scalability
API quotas and unreliable services hinder production deployment.

Development Speed
Companies need tools for faster PoC building and project management (better DX).

Human Support
A critical differentiator against unresponsive large providers.
