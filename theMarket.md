**AI adoption is already strong — but still early**
- 55% of organizations in developing markets already adopt AI solutions.
- Generative AI adoption is at 31%.
- Highly positive public sentiment in target market.

**Opportunity for first movers**
- High awareness, growing adoption, but market still fragmented.
- Lack of regional AI solution providers fully tailored to local needs.
- Limited local AI foundation models — room for regional models trained on local data.
- Growth in Startup Investment.

## Bottom's up analysis (focused on AI serving, not AI consumption)
We approximate the market size through a bottoms-up approach. For 2030 we estimate:

$$
710M (Latam’s Population) * 0.70 (Proportion of internet users) * 0.50 (Expected Proportion of GenAI software users) * 3.97 (Annual revenue (USD) / per user. Assuming 6M tokens per user) = 986M USD/year
$$

We aim to capture ~10% of this market in 5 years: 
98M USD/year 


- Latam’s forecasted population for 2030 [source](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/trends/Population2030.pdf)
- Proportion of Internet users for 2030 [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/873565/mobile-internet-penetration-rate-latin-america/)
- Expected proportion of software enhanced by GenAI → SURUS Assumption
- Annual revenue (USD) / per user → Calculated assuming 5, 0.5, 0.125, 0.05 USD per 1M tokens for our 70b, 8b, 1.5b, and embedding models respectively; a distribution of 10, 20, 35, 35 % on usage; and a total consumption of 6M tokens per year.

Although cost per 1M tokens is expected to decrease, per-user usage of tokens is expected to increase (Jevons paradox). We assume these two forces will result on a ~constant annual Revenue per user. 


NOTE: Maybe we should'nt add the bottoms up part because its the first estimation we did 6 months ago and its quite different from the top down estimate. Top down iMarc Group's estimation for 2030 latin america ai market is like 20Billion, and our bottoms up estimation is 986M USD.
