# SURUS: AI Lab for Latin America - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

SURUS addresses the $20B Latin American AI market gap by providing specialized models at 10x lower cost than global alternatives. We are the first regional AI lab focused on task-oriented models trained on LATAM data, with validated demand from 12 interviewed companies across legal, agro, and media sectors through our Sky Computing platform. Our competitive advantage lies in regional expertise that global players cannot replicate, positioning us to capture significant market share in a region where no company currently produces AI at scale.

**Elevator Pitch (â‰¤900 characters):**
SURUS is LatAm's first AI lab, providing domain-specific models 10x cheaper than OpenAI/Anthropic through specialized regional training. We serve the $20B LatAm AI market with task-oriented models for legal, agro, and media sectors. Our Sky Computing platform and deep regional expertise create insurmountable competitive barriers. With proven traction (Tango-70b, 12+ customers), we're positioned to dominate the specialized AI model segment and establish technological sovereignty for Latin America.

## Project Origin & Objectives

SURUS originated from identifying the critical bottleneck in Latin America's AI development: every company consumes AI but none produces it. Our research revealed that 100% of LatAm AI companies rely on expensive, inadequate general-purpose models from US providers, creating a $986M addressable market opportunity for specialized regional solutions.

**Primary Objective:** Become Latin America's dominant AI lab by training and serving task-oriented models that outperform global alternatives for regional use cases.

**Core Motivations:**
- **Market Gap**: No regional AI producer despite massive demand
- **Cost Crisis**: Companies paying 10x more for inferior performance
- **Technological Sovereignty**: LatAm's biggest opportunity for high-growth development

**Development Origin:** This project emerged from customer research showing universal pain points around cost, performance, and reliability of existing AI providers, validated through 12 detailed interviews across sectors.

## Customer Discovery & Validation

Our market validation process involved comprehensive interviews with 12 AI companies across diverse sectors, revealing quantified pain points that directly validate our value proposition. We currently serve a few early customers and are approaching nascent product-market fit.

**Customer Research Findings:**
