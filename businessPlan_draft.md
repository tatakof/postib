# SURUS: AI Lab for Latin America - Business Plan

## Executive Summary

SURUS is the AI lab for Latin America, providing domain-specific AI models through cost-effective APIs trained on LATAM data for superior local performance.

## The Problem

General-purpose AI models are too expensive and inadequate for Latin America's specific use cases, creating demand for specialized, cost-effective solutions.

## Our Solution

SURUS delivers domain-specific AI models through a unified API, offering specialized performance at 10x lower cost than general-purpose alternatives with cloud-agnostic infrastructure.

## Market Opportunity

Latin America's AI market is projected to reach $20B by 2030, with 55% organizational adoption already achieved but limited regional providers.

## Our Approach

We adopt China's optimization-first development model for LATAM: adapting existing innovations rather than creating new ones, training hundreds of specialized models for regional needs.

## Competitive Advantage

SURUS avoids AGI competition, focusing on small-to-mid-size models with deep LATAM expertise that global competitors cannot match.

## Business Model

API-based SaaS with subscription tiers (Dev: Free, Pro: $10/month, Enterprise: Custom) plus pay-per-use pricing with batching discounts.

## Current Traction

We've trained Tango-70b and Tango-8b (first Argentine LLMs), developed LATAM speech-to-text, and built surus.dev platform with multiple specialized models.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

Targeting AI product builders through LATAM AI communities, strategic partnerships, engineering marketing, and SEO-focused distribution.

## Long-term Vision

Become Latin America's comprehensive AI lab encompassing proprietary models, API platform, user applications, research, and open-source releases.

## Funding Requirements

Investment needed for full-time founding engineer, model trainer, marketing/sales lead, and community development to mitigate product, breakout, and community risks.

## Technology Infrastructure

Sky Computing architecture with cloud-agnostic deployment, ZenML training pipelines, and scalable model serving capabilities.

## Team & Execution

Proven track record in LATAM AI development with focus on adaptation, optimization, and scale over pure innovation.
