# Why

LatAm's biggest need and biggest shot at becoming the next high growth & development region is to develop and deploy custom AI at scale. 
Currently there's no company nor startup in LatAm working on this problem and/or trying to achieve this. All the companies and startups are *consuming* AI -but not producing it- and are dealing with the problem of lack of customized models, and spending a lot of time trying to adapt generalist models or models trained for other regions to LatAm's needs. 
This is the biggest bottleneck for LatAm's AI development, and thus the biggest opportunity/moonshot to pursue.
